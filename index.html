      <h1 class="center title-text">Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas!</h1>
      <h2 class="center title-text">From Jenn and AJ Diaz</h2>
      <p>We both had an exciting 2021. We started new jobs, adopted a new dog, and got married! We wanted to share some of our highlights with you all.</p>

      <p>In January Jenn started a new job as a Junior Software Engineer for a New England based start up, The Wanderlust Group ( https://thewanderlustgroup.com/ ) . She works primarily on their product Dockwa, a website and mobile app that helps to connect boat owners to marinas. She is happy that her work continues to get people outside and all of the talk of the ocean makes her miss New England.</p>

      <p>On May 15th we got married in Rocky Mountain National Park. We had a small lakeside ceremony at Sprague Lake and then had dinner in Estes Park. We had a guest appearance by a moose and got to experience the range of Colorado Weather including; wind, rain, sun, and a rainbow. 
      </p>
      <p>Shortly after our wedding we moved 1.5 hours north of Lakewood to Fort Collins Colorado. Fort Collins is a college town and known for loving bikes, beer and dogs. So we fit right in. We are enjoying exploring Fort Collins and are happy to be in a house with a fenced in yard. 
      </p>
      <p>Earlier in the year our 12 year old German Shepard Dog, Jackie, was diagnosed with a degenerative spine condition. We did all that we could to keep her comfortable including lots of pup cup desserts and the occasional steak. After a few weeks of enjoying our new yard, Jackie passed away. We miss her dearly and are happy that she got to spend 8 years with Jenn and 7 years with both of us.</p>
      <p>Not having a dog in the house was hard. In early September we welcomed Rizzo to the family. She is a 3 year old mixed breed 29 pound ball of love. We found her through a shelter that takes dogs from Texas that are not being adopted out of shelters and finds them homes in Colorado. We are looking forward to continuing to enjoy Fort Collins with her, she has the perfect chill temperament for an afternoon at a brewery or the energy for a day of hiking.</p>
      <p>In October, AJ began a job as a Junior Software Engineer with THT ( https://www.trouthousetech.com/ ). They work with various clients looking for mobile apps to meet their business needs. He works on iphone app and is enjoying learning more about mobile development. 
      </p>
      <p>During the Fall Jenn competed in her first ever mountain bike race, The Beti Bike Bash. She enjoyed having an event to train for and is looking forward to doing a handful of local races next year.</p>
      <p>For the rest of the year we are looking forward to lots of days spent skiing, AJâ€™s birthday, bringing Rizzo on weekend mountain adventures, and enjoying the holidays together. </p>
      <p>Our Fort Collins address is: </p>
        <p>Jenn and AJ Diaz </p>
